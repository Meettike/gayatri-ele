## 🚀 **Result:**

The Gayatri Electricals website now has a **clean, streamlined interface** focused entirely on:

3. **Business Contact** - Sales, support, partnerships
4. **Company Information** - About, policies, news

**The careers section has been completely removed** with no remaining traces in the codebase. The website maintains full functionality while being more focused on core business objectives.

### **Next Steps (If Needed):**
- If careers section is needed in future, create new `Careers.tsx` page
- Add back routing in `App.tsx`
- Restore navigation links in `Footer.tsx`
- Add careers inquiry option back to `Contact.tsx`

The removal is complete and the application is ready for production deployment.
