## File Structure
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ PartnersSection.tsx     # Main component
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ partners.ts             # Partner data and utilities
â””â”€â”€ pages/
    â””â”€â”€ Index.tsx               # Updated to include PartnersSection
```

## CSS Animations
Added to `src/index.css`:
```css
@keyframes infinite-scroll {
  0% { transform: translateX(0); }
  100% { transform: translateX(-50%); }
}

.animate-infinite-scroll {
  animation: infinite-scroll 30s linear infinite;
}

.animate-infinite-scroll:hover {
  animation-play-state: paused;
}
```

## Usage
The PartnersSection is automatically included in the main Index page between the AboutSection and TestimonialsSection.

## Customization

### Adding New Partners
Edit `src/data/partners.ts`:
```typescript
{
  id: "new-company",
  name: "New Company Name",
  logo: "/path/to/logo.png",
  website: "https://company.com",
  description: "Company description",
  industry: "Industry Type"
}
```

### Updating Company Logos
1. Add logo files to the `public/` directory
2. Update the `logo` field in `partners.ts` with the correct path
3. Logos should be approximately 200x100px for best results

### Styling Modifications
- Animation speed: Change duration in `.animate-infinite-scroll` class
- Card styling: Modify the card classes in `PartnersSection.tsx`
- Colors: Update using the existing design system variables

## Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Loading**: Images are loaded lazily
- **Optimized Animation**: Uses CSS transforms for smooth performance
- **Intersection Observer**: Animation only starts when visible
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation if images fail

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with CSS Grid and Flexbox support
- Intersection Observer API support (IE11+ with polyfill)
- CSS transforms and animations support

## Future Enhancements
1. **Real Company Logos**: Replace placeholder images with actual company logos
2. **Click Handlers**: Add navigation to company websites
3. **Testimonials Integration**: Link to specific testimonials from partners
4. **Industry Filtering**: Add ability to filter partners by industry
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Enhanced mobile experience with touch gestures
